# 🚀 UPC Algorithms Project — Delivery App Simulation (2025-10)

This project is a **Delivery App Simulation**, inspired by platforms like **Rappi**, developed as part of the **Algorithms course at Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas (UPC)** during the 2025-10 term.  
The main goal of the project is to apply and integrate multiple **data structures and algorithms** to simulate real-world operations of a delivery system.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview
The application simulates the core logic of a delivery platform, where users can:
- Register and place orders.
- Manage delivery routes.
- Process and assign deliveries efficiently using optimized data structures.

It focuses entirely on **algorithmic implementation and data structure management**, not on UI design.

## ⚙️ Core Functionalities
- 📦 **Order Management:** store, search, and update delivery requests.
- 🚴 **Delivery Assignment:** assign couriers based on priority using **heaps**.
- 🗺️ **Route Optimization:** simulate delivery paths using **binary trees** and **AVL trees**.
- 🔍 **Search & Sorting:** apply multiple **sorting algorithms** (QuickSort, MergeSort, BubbleSort) for performance comparison.
- 💾 **File Management:** read and process **flat files (.txt)** containing users, orders, and delivery data.
- 🧱 **Hash Tables:** efficiently manage user and order data with **hash functions**.
- 🔁 **Queues & Lists:** simulate delivery queues and order flows.
- 🌳 **Binary and AVL Trees:** represent hierarchical relationships between deliveries and couriers.

---

## 🧩 Data Structures Implemented
- **Linked Lists** (singly and doubly linked)  
- **Stacks and Queues**  
- **Binary Trees**  
- **AVL Trees (self-balancing)**  
- **Heaps (Min/Max)**  
- **Hash Tables**  
- **Graphs (optional extension)**  

---

## 🧪 Algorithms Applied
- **Sorting Algorithms:** QuickSort, MergeSort, BubbleSort  
- **Search Algorithms:** Binary Search, Linear Search  
- **Tree Balancing:** AVL rotation logic  
- **Hashing Techniques:** collision resolution via chaining or open addressing  

---

## 📂 File Handling
The system reads and writes **plain text files (.txt)** to manage data persistence for:
- Registered users  
- Active orders  
- Delivery history

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I practiced and reinforced:
- Implementation of **complex data structures** from scratch.  
- Understanding **algorithmic efficiency** and **Big O notation**.  
- Managing dynamic memory and node-based structures.  
- Reading and parsing structured data from text files.  
- Applying **sorting and searching** to real-world-like problems.
